Rails application with 2 pages:
- First page is a form with an input, where a user can type a question to ask the Coach.
- After submitting the form, the user is redirected to another page where she/he will see her/his question and the coach answer.

Biggest challnge:
- Build uppon Rails architecture
- Configure Routes, Controller and Views
- Configure Form accordingly
- Get params and implement the logic for different answers
